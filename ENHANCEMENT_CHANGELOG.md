## Technical Debt & Issues Log

### Known Issues:
1. **Font Loading Failures**: Google Fonts requests failing, causing retry loops
2. **Large Bundle Size**: Slow compilation times (4.6s for initial compile)
3. **Missing Error Boundaries**: App crashes propagate to entire application
4. **Inconsistent Data Types**: API responses don't match TypeScript interfaces
5. **Performance Issues**: No lazy loading, large bundle sizes

### Architectural Decisions:
- **State Management**: TanStack Query + Zustand for complex state
- **UI Framework**: ShadCN UI + Tailwind CSS (retained)
- **Visualization**: D3.js for network graphs
- **Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library + Playwright
- **Build Tool**: Next.js 14+ with Turbopack
